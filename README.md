# Effect of STDP Constant Distribution on Pavlovian Neural Network Simulation

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/872085826.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13926756)

This repository contains the code used to generate data for the paper:

"Effect of STDP Constant Distribution on Pavlovian Neural Network Simulation"

The simulation investigates the effect of applying gamma distributions to the STDP (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity) parameters. Specifically, `tauplus_gamma`, `tauminus_gamma`, `aplus_gamma`, and `aminus_gamma` indicate that gamma distributions were applied to the STDP parameters `tau_plus`, `tau_minus`, `A_plus`, and `A_minus`, respectively.

## Directory Structure

- `0_src/`: Contains the source code for running the simulations.
- `1_data/`: Stores the primary data generated by the simulations and the main parameters required for execution.
- `2_result/`: Contains processed data and plots generated using scripts like `plot.py`.

Within the `1_data/` and `2_result/` folders, results using different parameters are stored in subdirectories named `data_[num]/`.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the environment and run the simulations, please follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.9.16** if it's not already installed on your system.

2. **Install PyGeNN version 4.8.1**:
   - Follow the installation instructions provided in the PyGeNN documentation: [PyGeNN Installation Guide](https://github.com/genn-team/genn/blob/master/userdocs/pygenn.md)

3. **Install additional dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have all necessary Python packages installed, such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

## Dependencies

- **Python**: Version 3.9.16
- **PyGeNN**: Version 4.8.1 ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/genn-team/genn/blob/master/userdocs/pygenn.md))
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Simulation

Simulation execution can be done using `run_simulation.py`. You need to modify `run_simulation.py` to set the parameters you wish to use and the number of runs to perform. When executing the code, multiple simulations are performed sequentially with the environment settings you have specified.

To run the simulation:

```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

- **Note**: Ensure that you have modified `run_simulation.py` with the desired parameters and number of iterations before running.

### Generating Simulation Parameters

The script `parameter_generator.py` generates the necessary parameters for the simulator based on the environment settings provided in `run_simulation.py`. Depending on your requirements, you may need to modify this script.

### Data Processing and Plotting

Data processing can be done using `run_plot.py`. When you execute `run.py`, you will be prompted to enter the code to use for processing, which is generally `run.py`. It will also display the items in `plot_file.txt` as options. You can select the tasks you wish to perform, and upon entering the sigma value (`\sigma`) to use for the SDF plot, the plotting will commence.

To process data and generate plots:

```bash
python run_plot.py
```

- **Follow the on-screen prompts** to select the processing code and options.

### Integrating Results

After finishing data processing, you can integrate the results in `2_result/` by running `integrate_indicator.py` for statistical analysis.

To integrate results:

```bash
python integrate_indicator.py
```

## Data Availability

- The data required for analysis is generated by running `run_simulation.py`.
- Users need to run the simulation script to produce the data.
- Pre-generated data is not included in the repository.
